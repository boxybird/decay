He developed it himself and when he saw it, decided it was not satisfactory so he would not show it to the director. But he saw it anyway and Ellison got a contract.\n\nDespite his rugged good looks and height of 6 feet 3 inches, Ellison's limited range and somewhat wooden screen presence kept him from the first (or even second) ranks of stardom. He spent much of his career in Westerns, including a stint in the mid-thirties as the sidekick of Hopalong Cassidy in Paramount's successful series. In 1938, he played a charming, romantic character opposite 26 year old Lucille Ball in the comedy, \"Next Time I Marry\", a film where Ball had her first top billing on screen credits. Before that, in 1936, he played his highest-profile role, as Buffalo Bill in Cecil B. DeMille's The Plainsman, which also starred Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur.\n\nDespite that film's success, Ellison spent most of the remainder of his career shuttling between cowboy pictures and more varied roles, primarily in B movies with titles like Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case and The Undying Monster. He had a supporting role in 1941's Charley's Aunt (which starred Jack Benny) and played the romantic lead in 1943's The Gang's All Here, a Twentieth Century Fox musical in which he seemed somewhat lost among the vivid antics of Carmen Miranda, Charlotte Greenwood, and Edward Everett Horton (and was the only principal not to sing a note). He also co-starred with Tom Conway and Frances Dee in Val Lewton's production of I Walked with a Zombie, directed by Jacques Tourneur.\n\nEllison landed another romantic lead role as 'Jerry Gibson' in the musical film Lady, Let's Dance (1944) which starred ice skating sensation 'Belita'.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Ellison moved from acting to real estate. Joining fellow veteran Jackie Coogan, Ellison returned to the screen only once to play Axel 'Longhorn' Gates in a picture called When the Girls Take Over (1962).\n\nJames Ellison died at age 83 in Monterey, California after suffering a broken neck as the result of a fall.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Ellison (actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1910-05-04","deathday":"1993-12-23","gender":"2","homepage":null,"id":97037,"imdb_id":"nm0255199","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Ellison","place_of_birth":"Guthrie Center, Iowa, USA","popularity":3.746,"profile_path":"\/8AGbL7qMeXvlsS1niOpKvaXVdcV.jpg","combined_credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","genre_ids":[35,10749],"id":33630,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Vivacious Lady","overview":"College town life gets turned upside down after a button-down botany professor secretly weds a sizzling night-club singer.","popularity":6.049,"poster_path":"\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","release_date":"1938-05-13","title":"Vivacious Lady","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":52,"character":"Keith","credit_id":"52fe452a9251416c91029a41","order":2,"media_type":"movie","computed":{"backdrop_paths":{"w92":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w92\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","w154":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w154\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","w185":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w185\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","w342":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w342\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","w500":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w500\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","w780":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w780\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg","original":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/original\/eHklkFcGA3OoUt57OJOxRUMVnqO.jpg"},"poster_paths":{"w92":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w92\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","w154":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w154\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","w185":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w185\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","w342":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w342\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","w500":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w500\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","w780":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w780\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg","original":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/original\/lhkDEnO3gZLDAdLihgMpcRn38G.jpg"},"profile_paths":[],"still_paths":[],"logo_paths":[],"file_paths":[]}},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","genre_ids":[9648,27,18],"id":27130,"original_language":"en","original_title":"I Walked with a Zombie","overview":"A nurse in the Caribbean turns to voodoo in hopes of curing her patient, a mindless woman whose husband she's fallen in love with.","popularity":8.289,"poster_path":"\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","release_date":"1943-04-21","title":"I Walked with a Zombie","video":false,"vote_average":6.761,"vote_count":289,"character":"Wesley Rand","credit_id":"52fe452fc3a368484e04cff7","order":0,"media_type":"movie","computed":{"backdrop_paths":{"w92":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w92\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","w154":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w154\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","w185":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w185\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","w342":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w342\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","w500":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w500\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","w780":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w780\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg","original":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/original\/bCyK6eETwA6kzxLxDDuwJ3l7Wdw.jpg"},"poster_paths":{"w92":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w92\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","w154":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w154\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","w185":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w185\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","w342":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w342\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","w500":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w500\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","w780":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/w780\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg","original":"https:\/\/image.tmdb.org\/t\/p\/original\/uoyBR8XNxPQRojujtczfG1qJezY.jpg"},"profile_paths":[],"still_paths":[],"logo_paths":[],"file_paths":[]}},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"\/noru5obS1WoXVv9yi0ZPWakzuHN.jpg","genre_ids":[27,9648],"id":28558,"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Undying Monster","overview":"A werewolf prowls around at night but only kills certain members of one family.
